// Ready for a lightning-quick intro to Kotlin?! ⚡️





















// Let's start somewhere familiar for Java developers.
// Kotlin has classes. ✅


















// But then Kotlin has first-class, top-level, functions and variables too. ✅

private const val MESSAGE = "Hello, World!"

fun main() {
	println(MESSAGE)
}


// For a full appreciation of how awesome this is, see
// "Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns" by Steve Yegge
// https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html













// Kotlin has type and semicolon inference, super-duper strings,
// and a pretty nice type system. ✅





















// ...in fact, the type system even helps with null safety. ✅






















// Functions are quite expressive in Kotlin. ✅






















// Now the real fun begins, Kotlin has data classes
// and destructuring declarations.














// Kotlin has nearly seamless Java interoperability.

// Equality just works in Kotlin.

// Kotlin has 'when', which is better than switch.

// In Kotlin, 'if', 'when', 'try' are expressions.

// Kotlin has the singleton pattern built in.

// Kotlin has the delegate pattern built in.

// Kotlin banishes static to the ninth circle of /dev/null.

// Kotlin has extension functions, infix functions, inline
// functions with reified type parameters, function types
// with receiver, select operator overloading, and all that
// adds up to type-safe, internal builders and DSLs.

// Kotlin makes concurrency readable with coroutines.

// Kotlin goes native, and multi-platform, with
// Kotlin/Native (iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, WASM, IoT)
// and Kotlin/JS (browser, NodeJS).
