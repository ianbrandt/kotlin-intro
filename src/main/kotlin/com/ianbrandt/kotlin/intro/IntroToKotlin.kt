//	Let's learn a bit about about Kotlin...





















// Kotlin has good ole' classes ✅


















// Kotlin has first-class, top-level, functions and variables ✅

private const val MESSAGE = "Hello, World!"

fun main() {
	println(MESSAGE)
}


// For a full appreciation of how awesome this is, see
// "Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns" by Steve Yegge
// https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html













// Kotlin has type and semicolon inference, super strings,
// and a cool type system ✅





















// ...a type system so cool, it even helps with null safety ✅






















// Functions are expressive in Kotlin ✅






















// Now the real fun begins, Kotlin has data classes
// and destructuring declarations














// Kotlin has nearly seamless Java interoperability

// Equality just works in Kotlin

// Kotlin has 'when', which is better than switch

// In Kotlin, 'if', 'when', 'try' are expressions

// Kotlin has the singleton pattern built in

// Kotlin has the delegate pattern built in

// Kotlin banishes static to /dev/null, where it belongs

// Kotlin has extension functions, inline functions with
// reified type parameters, infix functions, function types
// with receiver, select operator overloading, and all that
// adds up to type-safe, internal DSLs!

// Kotlin makes concurrency readable with coroutines!

// Kotlin goes native, and multi-platform, with
// Kotlin/Native (iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, WASM, IoT)
// and Kotlin/JS (browser, NodeJS)
