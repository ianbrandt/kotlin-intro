// :07min. Kotlin! ⚡️
// https://youtu.be/JB2di69FmhE 😂














// Let's say hello! 👋















// Kotlin has classes. 😅


















// Kotlin also has first-class, top-level, functions and properties,
// along with type and semicolon inference. 🎉

private const val MESSAGE = "Hello, World!"

fun main() {
	println(MESSAGE)
}

// Kotlin super-duper strings, and a pretty nice variable and type system. 👍















// ...in fact, the type system even helps with null safety. 😯


















// Functions are quite expressive in Kotlin. 💃🕺


















// Kotlin has data classes and destructuring declarations. 🤓












// But wait, there's more!... 😲

// Kotlin has nearly seamless Java interoperability.

// Equality just works in Kotlin.

// Kotlin has 'when', which is better than switch.

// In Kotlin, 'if', 'when', 'try' are expressions.

// Kotlin has the singleton pattern built in.

// Kotlin has the delegate pattern built in.

// Kotlin banishes static to the ninth circle of /dev/null.

// Kotlin has extension functions, infix functions, inline
// functions with reified type parameters, function types
// with receiver, select operator overloading, and all that
// adds up to type-safe, internal builders and DSLs.

// Kotlin makes concurrency readable with coroutines.

// Kotlin goes native, and multi-platform, with
// Kotlin/Native (iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, WASM, IoT)
// and Kotlin/JS (browser, NodeJS).
